# Virtual Pet

Let me introduce you to my virtual JavaScript pet! It has a name, it ages, it gets hungry, it exercises and... it will sadly die! 

(This is one of my projects on the Manchester Codes bootcamp, to help sharpen my JS skills.)

## Some info on the project

I will update as we go, but this project will help me to... 

Get to grips with NPM
Practice TDD
Apply knowledge of objects, constructors and prototypes 
Re-factor code 
Practice programmatic thinking 

## Getting Started

To have a look at what I've done: 

- Clone this repository to your local machine by clicking 'clone' and selecting the HTTPS or SSH link
- Open your terminal, create a folder (mkdir virtual-pet) and within that run git clone <link-from-above>
- Then run npm init to install the necessary dependencies required for Node.js to run.
- Have a poke around! 

### Prerequisites

Jest - https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest

## Built With
